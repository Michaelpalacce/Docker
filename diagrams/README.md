Simple docker image used to install diagrams. Project taken from: https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio/blob/dev/debian/Dockerfile.
Some modifications to where the docker-entrypoint is stored as well as checking out specific tag(release).
Alpine version did not want to build at all, so debian it is.

Supports ARM64 and AMD64 processors
